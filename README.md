# Mehrad dotfiles

I'm just trying to archive my config so when I have to do it again, it won't be such a pain.

## How To

- Clone the repo to `~/dotfiles`.
- Excute the [install.sh] to sync the files.


## Tips

- AwesomeWM screenshot keys may have conflicts with some OS built-in shortkeys. try to disable them to avoid issues.
- This config is based on Manjaro Awesome edition. It rather use `dm-tool` instead of `i3lock` but I didn't remove the `i3lock`.

## Know Issues 
- XF86AudioLowerVolume and such don't work. I think XFCE shortkeys are preventing it.
